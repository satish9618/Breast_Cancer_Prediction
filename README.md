# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression üéóÔ∏è

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnosis using a Logistic Regression model. The focus was on building a robust, well-regularized model to avoid overfitting and improve generalization.

---

## Data Preprocessing ‚ú®
- **Duplicate & Null Value Removal:** Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate entries and handling missing values.
- **Outlier Detection & Cross-Validation:**  
  Tested multiple outlier detection methods including Box Plot, Z-Score, and Cook's Distance.  
  Selected the method that resulted in the least accuracy because higher accuracy indicated model overfitting.  
- **Feature Selection with RFE:**  
  Applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to remove unnecessary and highly correlated features, improving model simplicity and performance.

---

## Model Training & Evaluation üß†
- **Regularization:**  
  Used L1 regularization (Lasso) to reduce overfitting and enhance model robustness.
- **Workflow Tracking:**  
  The entire training pipeline‚Äîparameters, metrics, and artifacts‚Äîwas tracked using MLflow for reproducibility and easy experiment management.

## How to Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install required packages (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, mlflow)  
3. Run the main training script to preprocess data, train, and evaluate the model.  
4. Use MLflow UI to explore experiment results.

## Future Work üîÆ
- Experiment with other classifiers and ensemble methods  
- Fine-tune hyperparameters with grid search  
- Deploy the model using a web framework for real-time predictions
