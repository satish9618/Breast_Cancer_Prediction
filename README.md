# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression (L1 Reguralisation)ðŸ§¬

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnosis using a Logistic Regression model. The focus was on building a robust, well-regularized model to avoid overfitting and improve generalization.

---

## Data Preprocessing âœ¨
- **Duplicate & Null Value Removal:** Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate entries and handling missing values.
- **Outlier Detection & Cross-Validation:**  
  Tested multiple outlier detection methods including Box Plot, Z-Score, and Cook's Distance.  
  Selected the method that resulted in the least accuracy because higher accuracy indicated model overfitting.  
- **Feature Selection with RFE:**  
  Applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to remove unnecessary and highly correlated features, improving model simplicity and performance.

## Model Training & Evaluation ðŸ§ 
- **Regularization:**  
  Used L1 regularization (Lasso) to reduce overfitting and enhance model robustness.

## Experiment Tracking with MLflow ðŸš€

The entire machine learning workflow is tracked using **MLflow** for better reproducibility and experiment management. This includes:  
- Logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts  
- Comparing different model runs and tuning experiments  
- Ensuring a clear audit trail of model development steps  

Using MLflow has helped maintain transparency and efficiency throughout the model building process.
